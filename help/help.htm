<p>Fotorama_XH facilitates to embed <a href="http://fotorama.io/">Fotorama</a>
galleries on CMSimple_XH pages. The plugin doesn't offer any image upload
facility, but instead uses images from CMSimple_XH's images folder
or from somewhere else on the World Wide Web (only JPEG
are supported for now). Every gallery can have its own settings, and every image
can have an additional caption.</p>

<p><strong>Please do read this documentation <em>before</em> you encounter any
problems!</strong></p>

<h2 id="notice">Important Notice</h2>
<p><strong>Fotorama_XH hasn't been tested so far in various environments. It is
a so called beta version. Use with caution!</strong></p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Fotorama_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH &ge; 1.7.0. It requires PHP &ge;
5.3.0 and the "fileinfo", "gd" and "SimpleXML" extensions.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.
See the <a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation">
CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory fotorama/ to your server into CMSimple_XH's
plugins/ directory.</li>
<li>Set write permissions for the subdirectories cache/, css/, config/ and
languages/.</li>
<!--<li>Browse to Fotorama's administration (Plugins &rarr; Fotorama), and-->
<!--check if all requirements are fulfilled.</li>-->
</ol>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
the website's back-end. Select "Fotorama" from "Plugins".</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Fotorama_XH in "Config". Hints for the
options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done in "Language". You can translate the character strings
to your own language, if there is no appropriate language file available, or
customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Fotorama_XH can be customized in "Stylesheet".</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<h3 id="usage-preparation">Prepare a gallery</h3>
<p>At first you have to upload some images into a subfolder of CMSimple_XH's
image folder. You can either use CMSimple_XH's filebrowser or your favorite FTP
client. Then you have to create the gallery definition XML file in the back-end.
Navigate to Plugins &rarr; Fotorama &rarr; Galleries and use the form to create
an initial XML file with all images of the chosen folder. The name of the
gallery may only contain lower case Roman characters (a-z), Arabic digits (0-9)
and hyphens (-). The name of the gallery will be used as filename (.xml is
appended), and the file is stored in CMSimple_XH's content folder. Each language
has its own set of gallery definition files, so you can localize the image
captions.</p>
<p>After having successfully created the XML file, you are redirected to the
gallery editor where you can fine-tune the gallery by editing the XML file. You
can remove and add &lt;pic&gt; elements, and reorder them. For every &lt;pic&gt;
element you can optionally specify a caption attribute whose value will be shown
in the gallery; the caption will also be used as alt attribute of the HTML
&lt;img&gt;. You can change the value of the path attribute, but you must not
remove the attribute completely. Note that you should not touch the first three
lines of the file (the XML and the doctype declaration).</p>
<p>Furthermore you can specify additional attributes (the path attribute is
mandatory again) for the &lt;gallery&gt; element which affect the functionality
and look-and-feel of the gallery. The following attributes are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt>width and ratio</dt>
<dd>These attributes specify the width and aspect ratio of the gallery,
respectively. The width is either a plain number giving the width in pixels
(e.g. "400") or a percentage of the available horizontal space (e.g. "100%"),
which is especially useful for responsive layouts. The ratio is either a
fraction (e.g. 400/300 or 16/9) or a decimal numer (e.g. 1.3333). If these
attributes are omitted, the width and aspect ratio are determined by the first
image. Note that the images will be resized to fit within the width/ratio, so
that it's possible to have portrait and landscape images mixed in the same
gallery without distortion.</dd>
<dt>nav</dt>
<dd>Only "thumbs" is allowed if the attribute is specified. This will turn the
slim "dot" navigation into a thumbnail navigation. The required thumbnails are
automatically generated on the fly, and stored in the plugin's cache
directory.</dd>
<dt>fullscreen</dt>
<dd>This allows the visitor to enter fullscreen mode. Choose either "true", what
will restrict the fullscreen mode to the browser window, but also works for
older browsers, or "native" what uses the full screen size if supported by the
browser.</dd>
<dt>transition</dt>
<dd>Either "slide" (the default if the attribute is omitted), "crossfade" or
"dissolve". The latter is probably only useful if you have images that differ
only slightly; otherwise "crossfade" is preferable.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When the file is saved, it is automatically validated against the DTD. That
does not work if your working offline;
in this case you can disable the automatic validation in the plugin
configuration.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3 id="usage-external">External images</h3>
<p>
    It is also possible to show external images (i.e. images outside your images folder)
    by specifying the fully qualified absolute URL of the image as path of the pic element. 
    The usual caveats apply in this case, for instance, the image might not be available,
    and there might be legal constraints. Note that no thumbnails are generated for external
    images, but rather a default thumbnail is shown which you can change by replacing
    plugins/fotorama/images/external.jpg with an image of your choice.
</p>
<p>
    You can freely mix external images and images in the gallery folder
</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3 id="usage-embedding">Embed a gallery</h3>
<p>To embed a gallery on a page simply write:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:fotorama('%NAME%');}}}</pre>
<p>where %NAME% is the name of the gallery, e.g.</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:fotorama('holidays');}}}</pre>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>For the galleries to be <em>fully</em> functional, JavaScript has to be
enabled in the visitor's browser.</p>
